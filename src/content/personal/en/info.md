I'm Eduardo, from Venezuela, currently living in Madrid. I'm the **Mobile Lead and Full Stack Developer** at SwipeGuide. I'm an engineer and I love everything about it, electronics, 3D printing, robotics, etc.

With almost 10 years of experience in software development, I've specialized in mobile apps and web development. I love working on challenging projects and learning new technologies.
